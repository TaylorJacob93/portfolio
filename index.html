            I am based in Manchester as I have recently returned from travelling. I have spent
            the last 7 years in Germany, Portugal, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Chile & South East Asia 
            with Canada being my favourite place to live. In my spare time I like to try to just be in the fresh air
            and when possible I love to snowboard. I have spent the last year leaning Java, which I enjoyed very
            much however after speaking with some friends, a web development course seemed an option I had to jump into.

        <div class ="portfolio-info">

            I believe I wanted to get into coding because most of my teen to adult life I have been fasinated by
            computers and how they work. It wasnt until fairly recently, where after taking a couple of courses on 
            Udemy and Codegym, did I truly believe that it was in my power to learn web development, app design and
            hopefully many more ways to utilise computer languages. I love that with a few words from your keyboard you can
            create a whole world on the screen and it be your world, as I still even rememeber creating the first "Hello 
            World" on Intellij Idea over 2 years ago like it was yesterday.

        <p class="portfolio-info">Java, but also I am 4 weeks into the Manchester Code bootcamp so I plan to understand and impliment
            CSS, HTML, JavaScript & React in the near future. I believe in regards to life experience, I have this in abundance as I 
            have lived in many cultures, working in the entry level jobs and so I feel although that I skipped university, I was educated by
            the world.</p>
